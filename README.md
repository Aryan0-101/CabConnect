# CabConnect

## Q. Describe Your Product.

Our platform CabConnect aims to connect customers looking for easy and reliable travel solutions with local agencies. Current cab services are unreliable for long trips. Customers often face issues like drivers turning down rides or being unavailable at the last moment, prices keep on changing with availability. Our aim is to take away these headaches by teaming up with trusted local travel agencies that focus on long-distance travel.

We also aim to provide personalized experience for each segment of users. Customer segments like elders and pet owners, often have a hard time finding personalized travel options. By collaborating closely with local agencies, we can offer customized solutions that make long-distance travel easy and enjoyable for everyone. Unlike standard cab apps that might surprise users with high costs or hidden fees, CabConnect aims to provide transparent pricing to the users.

## Q. Why has the team chosen this product to develop?

We have chosen to work on and develop this product because it addresses a challenge that we have personally experienced as college students living in another state as traveling long distances has always been tough due to the limitations of current transportation options. These issues inspired us to look for and create a better solution. 

Some of the problems that we face are: 

1. Ride Refusals:
    - Often times we have faced drivers who would decline the ride request after asking for the location if they just don’t feel like going or for some other reason, it is very infuriating especially when you are in a hurry.
2. Unavailability:
    - Finding a ride during holidays or during rush hours or late at night has been a different kind of challenge. This has been such a problem especially during emergency situations as it just leaves you stranded with no options at all.
3. High Costs:
    - Long-distance trips are already expensive through these platforms add to that their price surge or some other charges they would add to it, and it gets even more expensive.
4. Lack of alternatives:
    - There aren’t any good alternative to choose from.

## Q. What Problem(s) it solves?

CabConnect fixes many problems of the traditional cab services:

- Availability: CabConnect guarantees you a ride no matter how busy it gets or whether it is a holiday or not.
- Price Surge: ****Our platform guarantees the user a clear upfront pricing which would be fixed so the user knows what they are paying.
- Unreliability: In existing ride-hailing platforms often times drivers refuse long trips or cancel at the last minute which ruins the customers plans. CabConnect connects you to professional travel agents guaranteeing you a ride.
- Geographic Limitations: The local travel agencies are well versed with the areas and know the areas inside out therefore they are able to serve even in the remotest areas.
- Flexibility and Personalization: Current cab/ride platforms generally don’t provide users options to personalize their ride and their drivers. Our platforms would provide the user full freedom of choosing agencies that would cater to their needs.

---

## Q. Who will be the potential clients/customers/users/startups/beneficiaries of the product? Describe appropriately. Why do you think they are your target audience?

CabConnect is for the users who have struggled with long-distance travel, and it is also for the Travel-agencies who are unable to expand their reach and grow. 

**Primary Audience:** 

1. Individual Users: College students, working professionals, and families needing long-distance travel options as they frequently face ride refusals, unavailability, or high costs with ride services for long trips. 
2. Personalized Travel: Family travel, Elderly users, pet owners require their travel to be personalized according to their needs like, Families require a larger vehicle to travel, Elders and disabled require some extra help from the drivers.

Secondary-Target:

1. Local-travel agencies: Our platform will also be an opportunity for local travel services to grow and expand their business and reach. 
2. Event-organizers: Event organizers such as tour planners would have their travel sorted by partnering with us, connecting organizers and travel agencies would help in managing the even better.

## Q. What will be the innovation in this project?

There is a lot that can be improved in the current solutions to long-distance travel, some of the innovations that CabConnect would be providing are: 

1. Collaboration with local travel agencie**s** creating a network of trusted cab service providers. Partnering with these agencies enables us to guarantee availability of cars, personalization for each customer and better offers for long-distance travel. 
2. Personalized Travel Options ****are something that the current cab services don’t offer but is as important for customers as everything else. We aim to offer full freedom to the customers to select the travel agencies they wish to travel with and get suitable drivers and rides for their needs. 
3. A Dynamic Pricing and Transparent Fair system ****with no surge in prices. 
4. Wider Reach even to the remotest areas with the help of local travel agencies which guarantees rides no matter the location. 
5. Necessary Safety Features like verified drivers, real time tracking, SOS button and 24/7 customer support helps build trust with the user.

## Q. How it will be different from similar existing solutions? Take at least three existing applications which are most closer to your project proposal and how you will be differentiating and benchmarking with these three.

Our platform offers unique features and focuses on solving specific challenges that existing cab hailing platforms like **Ola**, **Uber**, and **Meru cabs** fail to address effectively.

**1. Ola and Uber**

These are the go-to apps for quick rides, but these are mostly built for short trips. There are many problems that they don’t address like surge pricing, no availability guarantee and no personalization options. 

**2. Meru Cabs**

This is another cab service known for inter-city travel including airport transfers while they are good in certain aspects they have their own set of limitation like, Fixed rates that are generally not the best value, No personalization, focus mainly in major cities. 

**How are we different?** 

- We aim to provide ride options tailored according to the needs of the customer.
- Customers can plan trips in advance with guaranteed availability.
- Local travel agencies ensure wider reach and reliable service even in rural areas.
- Fixed fares for long-distance trips, avoiding surge pricing.

## Q. What makes it challenging enough to be chosen to be done in four months (Jan -
May)?

Creating a platform like CabConnect requires a lot brainstorming and research before even beginning to work on the platform itself. Some of the tasks that make it challenging enough to be done in four months are: 

1. Integrating Local agencies: Contacting local agencies and getting them to agree to work with our model would be tough as they operate on different kind of model and pricing. 
2. Developing the platform: The front-end needs to be appealing and easy to use for the customers and the agencies. The back-end should be able to handle multiple customers and agencies at the same time.  
3. Adding personalization features: Adding additional features makes the booking process even more complex. 
4. Designing a transparent and fair pricing model: Creating a model that is fair to the customers as well as the agencies while still being profitable will be a time intensive task. 

Even after all this the model would still be around 30-40% completed deployment of model would take a lot more time after that.

## How will you measure the success/outcome/quality of your product?

To judge our product on and determine its success/quality we’ll ask ourselves some questions: 

1. Have we completed and integrated all the promised features? 
2. Is the platform user-friendly for both customers and agencies? Can they access all its features without any problem? 
3. How many people are signing up and using the platform? Are users coming back to book again?
4. Are the agencies able to manage their bookings, vehicles, and drivers? and is there any increase in their business because of the platform?
5. Are the users and agencies satisfied with the service?
6. How much money is the platform generating? and are we profitable?

## Q.  Evidence/literature/research/survey etc. in support of the hypothesis or idea to be
successful.

To validate the feasibility of our idea, we have analyzed market trends, did some surveys, talk to out mentors at Bennett University Hatchery and industry reports across local, national and international context.
The evidence highly supports in favor of our idea and strongly supports the demand for structured long-distance cab travel service with local-partnership, custom travel packages, eventually leading to our fleet model.

Industry Growth and Market Demand: 

1. India’s Ride Hailing market: Statista Report (2023), the Indian ride-hailing market is projected to reach around $12.35 billion by 2025. But most of the cab-services hail to short-distance travel usually intracity.
2. Growing Intercity Travel Demand: A report by IBEF (India Brand Equity Foundation) states that the Indian travel and tourism market contributes around 95 to the GDP, with rise in domestic tourism.
3. Expansion of Digital Cab-Booking: McKinsey’s 2023 global mobility found out that over 80% of the commuters prefer online booing platforms for convenience.

Case studies and Successful Business Models: 

1. Ola Outstation and Uber Intercity: These services proved to be outstating in catering to the intracity commuters but fail to perform well in providing long-distance travel, facing issues such as high pricing, limited city coverage, lack of customized package, and mainly due to its directly connect to user model.
2. BlaBlaCar (Europe): European ride-sharing intercity cab service showed successful execution in Europe. Providing structured intercity transport, it shows that with right execution, CabConnect can really impact travel in India.

Customized Survey:
We made our own survey asking basic questions such as, how often do people travel long-distance, what options do they prefer (Ola/Uber or Local Agencies), what is the main reason for choosing Local Agencies, understating their requirements to travel long distance and making necessary arrangements in put app and model.

Findings of our survey: 

1. Most of the people travel monthly
2. More than 70% prefer on car, people don't use cab services/carpool very often
3. Comfort, convenience & cost effectiveness are top priority for choosing these options
4. More than 50% combined use cab services rarely, sometimes and never
5. Main reason for not using cab services: 1. Prefer own vehicle 2. Too expensive 3. No drivers 4. Poor service
6. 62% people combined contact their local agencies every time / sometimes
7. Top three reasons to go local: 1. Personalization 2. Trust 3. Better Pricing
8. Top priority to travel: comfort, cost, travel time.
9. Expectations from our product: Affordable pricing, Reliability, Safety, Comfort.

## Q. Risk Analysis (What are the factors which pose risk of failure of your project and risk of
not completing your project by deadline).

Potential risks of our project:

1. Operational Risks:
    1. Reliability of Local Agencies: Before building our own fleet model, we highly depend on local agencies which may lead to inconsistent service and availability.
    2. Shortage of drivers: Lack of trained, professionals in some areas.
2. Financial Risks: 
    1. High Initial Costs: Developing an app, marketing, partnering/onboarding with Local Agencies require funds.
3. Technical Risks:
    1. App issues like bugs, crashes, cyber security threats could reduce trust.
4. Market Risks:
    1. Competition: Ola/Uber pose significant challenges in the market but catering to this segment would require them to redefine their whole business model.
    2. Lack of Partnerships: Failure to onboard significant number of Local Agencies might lead to delay in deployment.
